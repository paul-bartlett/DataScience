\section{Description of Applied
Problem}\label{description-of-applied-problem}

The trends of popular music can easily be attained through the various
Billboard charts that have existed for over 50 years. The problem with
getting data from these charts is that popular music generally isn't
critically acclaimed, and is therefore not as interesting as data from
sources that evaluate music more objectively. Using a dataset that
includes over 18,000 reviews from Pitchfork, I will be going through the
data to find how critically acclaimed music has changed over time. and
the charts don't tell us about the musical trends of the highest rated
artists and albums.
