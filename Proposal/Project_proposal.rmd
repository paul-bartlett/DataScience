# Description of Applied Problem
The trends of popular music can easily be gotten through Billboard charts that have existed for over 50 years. The problem with getting data from these charts is that popular music generally isn't critically acclaimed, and the charts don't tell us about the musical trends of the highest rated artists and albums.
