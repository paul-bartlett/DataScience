abstract: The purpose of this analysis is to identify relationships between musical genre of critically acclaimed albums and time. The dataset used for this analysis contains over 18,000 reviews from Pitchfork from January 5th, 1999 to January 8th, 2017. It contains important data including release year, artist name, genre, and a score ranging from 0.0-10.0. The findings may be useful for determining what the most successful genre of critically acclaimed music is for each of the last 18 years.

# Description of Applied Problem
The trends of popular music can easily be attained through the various Billboard charts that have existed since 1955. A group of scientists from the University of London analysed around 17,000 songs that charted on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 over the last 50 years and created a visualization of the popularity of musical genres over time [@Billboard100]. The problem with getting data from these charts is that popular music generally isn't critically acclaimed, and is therefore not as interesting as data from sources that evaluate music more objectively. Using a dataset that includes over 18,000 reviews from Pitchfork, I will be going through the data to find how critically acclaimed music has changed over time. In addition, I will also be looking at which release from an artist is the most well received. A general pattern I've seen when listening to several albums from an artist is that the first 2-3 albums tend to be the best from their discography. I would like to use the data to confirm or deny this assumption.
and the charts don't tell us about the musical trends of the highest rated artists and albums.
