\begin{abstract} 
{\bf } The purpose of this analysis is to identify relationships between
musical genre of critically acclaimed albums and time. The dataset used
for this analysis contains over 18,000 reviews from Pitchfork from
January 5th, 1999 to January 8th, 2017. It contains important data
including release year, artist name, genre, and a score ranging from
0.0-10.0. The findings may be useful for determining what the most
successful genre of critically acclaimed music is for each of the last
18 years. \end{abstract}
